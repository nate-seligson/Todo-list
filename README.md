# To-Do List || April 2024
  This project is a todo list tracker app. You can add and remove tasks customize their color.

  You can also customize the background color by moving your cursor to the top left of the screen.

The goal of this project was to learn how to create a seamless, visually appealing UI using HTML, CSS, and JS. And, learn how to save and keep track of data so that your tasks aren't lost when you close out of the page. I did this using localStorage.
## Notes
- My CSS is not as clean as it could be. I am often reusing lines of code and making large chunks where there does not need to be one
- I have trouble with positioning elements in a way that works for all screen sizes, took a lot of debugging to fix.
- I use an addEventListener and then a removeEventListener to have something run once, probably not best practice.
